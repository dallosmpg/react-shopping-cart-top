# Shopping cart page with react
## Planning
### Components needed
- Home
- Shop
  - Product
- Nav
  - The shopping cart widget might be part of the navbar

### State needed
I might only need state for the shopping cart.

### Planned dev process
1. Lay out the page statically with every component
   1. Im creating styling as well so i know in place what i need to do, so i dont have to remember later
   2. I decided to write tests as writing out basic components as well


## Devlog
### Problems and solutions 
1. I need to relearn testing as i have gotten quite unfamiliar with it since i last had to test in TOP
   1. Im trying to use chatGPT as much as possible to compensate
